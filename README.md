# Weight Tracker Application

## Overview
The Weight Tracker application is a React-based web app that allows users to log their daily weight and visualize it in a line graph. Users can also edit or delete existing entries, and the app ensures data is always stored in ascending order of dates. The app uses local storage to persist data across sessions.

## Features
- **Add Weight Entries:** Users can select a date and enter their weight.
- **Date Validation:** Dates cannot be greater than the current date.
- **Undo Feature:** Users can undo an overridden entry within 5 seconds.
- **Delete Feature:** Users can manually delete weight entries.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays the weight history in a line graph using Chart.js.
- **Data Persistence:** Stores data locally using `localStorage`.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
- **Chart Library:** Chart.js
- **Date Picker:** `react-datepicker`
